            <div class="tab">
                <ul>
                    <li><p>I am a programmer, mainly doing game and mod development, but also some other things on occasion, for example this website.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I play videogames, only PC ones and almost exclusively indie titles. Can't say that I do that a lot, but I sure played a tone of different stuff in the past, and also sunk many hours into sandbox games.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>Always loved art, so I started learning to make it myself! Currently it's very simple, but I practice occasionally. If programming can be called my main thing, art is my side activity.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>I love music! In fact I even know how to play piano! Although I don't listen to bands or individual performers, so almost all stuff is electronic. Logically, this means that I mostly listen to game OSTs, tracks and albums from various individual composers.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <h2># Programming and Skills</h2>
            <div class="tab">
                <ul>
                    <li><p>I know C#, Java, Python and GLSL/HLSL. Also worked a bit with C, Lua and Kotlin. I use VS and Rider for C#, Idea for Java and vscode for other things.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I have a lot of projects, sadly I rarely finish them. Most are mods, I mod Minecraft, Terraria and Duck Game. Also, I recently became a member of Lodestar Minecraft modding team!</p></li>
                    <li><p>And I make games. Nothing much serious, my biggest project up to date is a whole (still unannounced) fanmade Deltarune Chapter.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Can't say that's my specialization, but I really enjoy experimenting with shaders and vfx, so that's a thing I do often.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Expect a dedicated "Projects" page sometime soon.</p></li>
                    <li><p>From non programming skills, I can also do different stuff in Blender and FL Studio (although I am not a 3D artist nor a composer)</p></li>
                </ul>

            <div class="tab">
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Hmmmm, where do I even start? I like a lot of games, and as I said above, most of them are indies.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I play basically all genres, except most turn-based strategies, fightings and online shooters.</p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        My gaming "hall of fame" consists of: 
                        Minecraft, Terraria, Undertale, Deltarune, Pizza Tower, Geometry Dash, Celeste, Duck Game, Sonic Mania, Spelunky 2, Shovel Knight, The Messanger.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>I am also a huge fan of some franchises (series), specifically Sonic the Hedgehog (especially old games) and FNaF (especially old games again, lol).</p></li>
                    <li><p>From rhythm games, my favorite one is by far ADOFAI, although I am not very good at it.</p></li>
                    <li><p>From more social games, I really like ATLYSS, also looking to get into similar game, for example Webfishing.</p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>I recently started doing art! I rarely have the mood for it, and it takes a lot lot time for me to make a drawing, but I am trying. =w=</p></li>
                    <li><p>Usually the stuff I draw are drawings of my sona and also some practice pieces once in a while. Wanna start doing more sketches and quick drawings too.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I am still learning, so I don't have an artstyle and I rarely participate in art related stuff. Right now, my goal is to just improve.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I'll make a dedicated art gallery page once I have enough!</p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>It's really hard to condense my music preferences, so I'll make a page for my favorite music at some point.</p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        But for now, my favorite game OSTs are:<br>
